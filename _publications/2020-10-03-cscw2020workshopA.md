This paper takes a first step to systematically review and collectively evaluate #CivicTech works done in the computer science discipline, especially the vibrant community of CSCW. Based on 50 full papers published in CSCW, we ran a quantitative content analysis of the works. We found that civic tech is a growing young field with interests from all over the world, across academic, governmental, and commercial sections. While we are progressing well towards the goal of “for the citizens”, “by the citizens” remains largely absent. We call for a more balanced approach to civic tech, both in developing cutting edge technologies and in adapting laymen and popular technologies for civic purposes.
