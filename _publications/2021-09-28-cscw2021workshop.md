Automated fact-checking has been used to address the tremendous volume of misinformation online. Engaging with the dialogue on human-centered AI, we consider the use of explainable AI for automated fact-checking. We discuss the research question, the design of a comparative study of explainable AI interfaces to aid in the investigation, and the potential implications on human-centered AI.
