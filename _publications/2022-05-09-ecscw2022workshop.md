Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in digital products for a wide variety of purposes like content creation, recommendation, surveillance and judgment. With AI technologies designed with the intent of assisting humans becoming more common, understanding how users perceive and interact with AI becomes an important line of investigation. A key aspect is trust. Trust is concerned with the confidence users have in AI and their propensity to use it. While it may not necessarily translate into behavior, trust is integral in determining whether users will even consider using AI. With advances in AI research enabling AI systems to perform better and be designed in more realistic ways, we aim to look at how accuracy and anthropomorphism affect trust in AI. We have a study in plan and describe the design, inquiry and considerations of it.
